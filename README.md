# telegram-assistant-bot

Telegraf library used.

Here's a telegram assistant bot that helps 
- to get materials from the google docs (gives links to it), 
- tells about service the person provides with
- helps to leave feedback
- helps to pay for provided services as well. (bot payments used)

As this bot was written for telegram and the telegram app by default download files sent to your chat, I decided to use just link to Gooogle docs so people won't need to download materials.

to try out the bot find it in telegram:
